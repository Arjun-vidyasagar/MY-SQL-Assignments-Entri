# Assignment 1-DDL Commands
This assignment involves creating and manipulating a database named School to demonstrate various DDL commands in SQL. A table named STUDENT was created with fields Roll_No, First_Name, Last_Name, Marks, and Grade, incorporating constraints for data integrity. Sample data was inserted, and the SELECT command was used to display records. The table was altered by adding a Contact column and removing the Grade column. It was then renamed to CLASSTEN, and all rows were deleted using the TRUNCATE command while retaining the table structure. Finally, the table was permanently removed using the DROP command, showcasing the complete lifecycle of table management in SQL.

# Assignment 2-DDL Constraints
This assignment involves creating and managing a database named "Sales", starting with the creation of a table named Orders that includes fields for Order_Id, Customer_name, Product_Category, Ordered_item, and Contact_No, with appropriate constraints like Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null. The table was then modified by adding a new column order_quantity, renaming it to sales_orders, and inserting 10 rows of sample data. Various SQL operations were performed, such as retrieving specific columns (Customer_name and Ordered_item), updating a product name based on Order_Id, and finally deleting the sales_orders table. 

# Assignent 3-DML Commands
This assignment involves creating a table named Managers with fields including Manager_Id, First_Name, Last_Name, DOB, Age (with a CHECK constraint), Gender, Department, and Salary (NOT NULL). The assignment demonstrates key SQL operations such as table creation, inserting 10 rows, and performing various queries. These include retrieving the name and date of birth of a manager with Manager_Id 1, calculating the annual income of all managers, displaying records excluding a specific manager named 'Aaliya', filtering managers from the IT department earning above 25,000 per month, and selecting managers with salaries between 10,000 and 35,000.
